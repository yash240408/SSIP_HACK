<h2 align="left" > Description</h2>

The AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM CONTROLLER is an **RFID Based Restaurant Food Ordering System** ,initially made for 36 hour hackathon by SSIP
- It is a web-based system that makes the sprinkling of water automatically.
- The sprinkler sprinkles the water as per the moisture level
- The project is based on AUTOMATIC IRRIGATION SYSTEM CONTROLLER
- The system eliminates the need for manual sprinkling of water in small farm lands.
- The aim is to provide an innovative and futuristic experience to the farmers.

<h2 align="left" > Configuration</h2>

- Present a handy module consisting of Ultrasonic Sensor, Soil Moisture Sensor and microsystems which are used to sprinkle water at several intervals..
- The sprinkler sprinkles the water as per the moisture level
